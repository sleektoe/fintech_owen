 An important characteristic of each string is its length, which is the number of characters in it. The length can be any natural number (i.e., zero or any positive integer).

Functions, arrays, and strings are stored in variables. Bash uses what we call attributes to flag changes in behaviors on assignment. Despite there being a system to modify the behavior of variable assignment, when it all comes down to it, values are stored in variables as strings.
